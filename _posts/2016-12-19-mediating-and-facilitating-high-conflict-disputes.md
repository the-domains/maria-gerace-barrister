# Mediating and facilitating high conflict disputes

I have a keen interest in the facilitation and mediation of high conflict disputes.

Specialist skills are needed to assist people and organisations to navigate tricky or highly charged situations. Badly managed conflicts can have crippling financial, psychological and emotional consequences.

Litigation or conflicts arising from fraud, dishonest dealings, abuse, defective products, catastrophic personal injury or financial disaster are invariably highly charged. 

Parties need legal strategies that recognise and are able to respond to the challenges of high conflict disputes.
